This project was completed as part of SEC-101: Data and Information Fundamentals and focuses on understanding the full data pipeline, from raw data acquisition to building a simple AI model using a real-world dataset. The dataset used in this project contains used-car listings collected from an online German marketplace and includes both numerical and categorical attributes such as mileage, registration year, engine power, brand, fuel type, and price.

The main objective of this project is to demonstrate how raw data is explored, cleaned, and preprocessed before it can be used for AI model training. Throughout the project, common data quality issues such as missing values, unrealistic numeric ranges, inconsistent categorical labels, and redundant attributes were identified and resolved. All cleaning and preprocessing steps were designed following the concepts discussed in class, including data quality dimensions, handling missing values, outliers, and data representation.

After preprocessing, a machine learning pipeline was built using a Random Forest Regressor to predict used-car prices. The final model was trained and evaluated on the cleaned dataset and achieved strong performance, showing that proper data preparation plays a critical role in building effective AI systems. Overall, this project demonstrates a complete and structured approach to transforming raw data into meaningful insights and a functional AI model.
